##  2. <a name='Overview'></a>Overview
This repo contains the code for the implemenation of the master's thesis "Explaining Neural NLP Models To Understand Students' Career Choices". 

We analyze influencing factors that drive student career decisions. Our underlying dataset is the Engineering Major Survey (EMS 1.0), collecting open and closed ended answers to questions related totopics like background and universitiy experiences.

We introduce a new approach for analyzing this survey with methods from deep learning. Moreover the approach is a general blueprint for analyzing mixed surveys containing qualitative information more efficiently and effectively.

Our approach consists of 3 parts. 

1. [Classification](#Classification): 
   
   - Prediction of students' career goals (labels) from closed-ended answers (numerical input features) and open-ended answwers (text input features). 
   - Usage of a modular neural network architecture, that combines the different input streams.  
   - Automatic convertion of qualitative text input to numerical feature input with the extraxtion of contextual text embeddings using the language model BERT.
   - Conduction of model architecture and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best model performance. 

2. [SHAP_Explanation](#SHAP_Explanation):
    - Measurement of contextual text embedding and numerical feature contribution to the model's prediction (locally for specific predictions and globally for all predictions)
    - Measurement of text input contribution to the text embedding neurons with the highest activation (locally for specific predictions)
    - Measurement of text input contribution to the model's prediction (locally for specific predictions)
    
3. [ConceptSHAP_Explanation](#ConceptSHAP_Explanation):
    - Training of a surrogate model to extract concepts with corresponding concept vectors in an unsupervised fashion, with a "Completeness score" as a measurement for recovering the original model.
    - Characterization of latent language concepts by 
        - a) a concept vector's top k nearest neigbour word embeddings, with the sentence slice they occur in.
        - b) a word cloud consisting of the words form the sentence slices that occur most often
    - Measurement of the concepts' contribution to the model's predictions (globally for all predictions) by ConceptSHAP values.

##  3. <a name='Dependencies'></a>Dependencies
If you use conda as your virtual environment manager you can install the environment by running the following: 

    `conda env create -f mt.yml`

Otherwise the packages required can be found in ```requirements.txt```

##  4. <a name='StructureandOperation'></a>Structure and Operation

The code is structured in 3 main folders ```Classification```, ```SHAP_Explanation``` and ```ConceptSHAP_Explanation``` corresponding to the 3 experiment steps plus one extra ```Data``` folder containing all the datasets. 

In ```constants.json``` you can change all the important hyperparameters to run different experiments. The current version shows the best set of architecture variables and training parameters.

The prediction/label and input variables, we choose for our experiments from the dataset are defined in ```dataset_variables.json```.

1. Prediction variable

    **q20**: *"How likely is it that you will do each of the following in the first five years after you graduate?"*. 
        
    It provides eight career possibilities, which will be our prediction heads:

    0. **q20asbus**: Work as an employee for a small business or start-up company 
    1. **q20blbus**: Work as an employee for a medium- or large-size business
    2. **q20cnon**: Work as an employee for a non-profit organization (excluding a school or college/university)
    3. **q20dgov**: Work as an employee for the government, military, or public agency (excluding a school or college/university)
    4. **q20etch**: Work as a teacher or educational professional in a K-12 school
    5. **q20fcoll**: Work as a faculty member or educational professional in a college or university
    6. **q20hsnon**: Found or start your own for-profit organization
    7. **q20gsfor**: Found or start your own non-profit organization

    Each of them has a value range from **0** meaning **"Definitely will not"** to 4, meaning **"Definitely will"**. 
    
    However, we bin the values from 5 to 2 values (0 and 1) in order to reduce the model complexity. (Adjustet in the ```constants.json``` file) 

2. Input variables
    
    The input is split in **text variables** and **numerical feature variables**:
    
    **a) Text variables:**

    We take two different text variables from the EMS 1.0 dataset as our model input. Both of them are processed in seperate streams and merged on an embedding level.
    1. **q22career**: *We have asked a number of questions about your future plans. If you would like to elaborate on what you are planning to do, in the next five years or beyond, please do so here."*
    2. **inspire**: *"To what extent did this survey inspire you to think about your education in new or different ways? Please describe."*

    **b) Numerical feature variables:**

    We process the 119 numerical feature variables in 8 different topics as defined in ```dataset_variables.json```: 
    1. topic "learning experiences": 47 variables
    2. topic "self-efficacy": 14 variables
    3. topic "innovation outcome expectations": 4 variables
    4. topic "background characteristics": 22 variables
    5. topic "innovation interests": 7 variables
    6. topic "career goal: innovative work": 6 variables
    7. topic "job targets": 6 variables
    8. topic "current contextual influences": 13 variables

The ```/SHAP_Explanation``` folder contains all files to run 3 explanation experiments based on SHAP. 
It explains the classification model with the best performance, having the following architecture:
- Input: Text (q22career) + numerical features (all of the 8 topics)
- Prediction head: regression
- Extraction of text embeddings: BERT + "mean" over word vectors
- Number of layers for festure topic streams before text and numerical feature concatenation: 0
- Number of layers after text and numerical feature concatenation: 4
- Number of hidden units per layer: 512
- Batch norm: no
- Dropout: No

Main jupyter notebooks: 

Calculating the SHAP values, which measure and visualize the feature contribution to the model's predictions:
- ```main_text_feature_classifier_split_model.ipynb``` 
    1. Experiment: calculates and visualizes SHAP values measuring the contribution of text embedding and numerical feature input to the model's 8 prediction heads (locally for specific samples and globally for all samples)
    2. Experiment: calculates and visualizes SHAP values measuring the contribution of word tokens to the text embedding neurons with the highest activation (extracted from the experimenmnt) locally for a specific sample
    
    The weights for the best model are loaded from ```constants.json```:
